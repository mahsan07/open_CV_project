Jupyter Notebook project for Face and text detection in images. It uses PIL, openCV and tesserract libraries for image processing
# Pre loaded images in Kernel are used as reference. Image paths can be changed to be loaded from a local machine
# This program takes in a word as user input and scans the sample images for that word. In this case, the images are newspaper pages.
# Which ever page contains that word, image is scanned for any faces in that page. 
# The output consists of detected face cropped out and arranged in order from all the images containing the word given by the user.
# If If no face detected in a page with given word then just outputs string 'no face detected'
